# Description

This repository contains frontend code for [MyCity](http://mycity.io) platform.

# Dependencies

This frontend code relies on [MyCity API Server](http://docs.mycity.apiary.io) for data storage.

Source code is written in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).

MyCity frontend is a Single-Page Application (aka [SPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) built with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/).

You _should be_ familiar with mentioned technologies if you want to do something major. But don't worry if you
aren't: build procedures include options to create uncompressed HTML, CSS and JavaScript files for all the
tweaking.

# Downloading

The easiest way to obtain your own copy of this code is to install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and then
perform a clone command like this:

	git clone https://github.com/mycityio/frontend.git

This will create a directory called `frontend` that contains everything you need to test
and run MyCity frontend code, provided that you have access to a working [MyCity API Server](http://docs.mycity.apiary.io).
